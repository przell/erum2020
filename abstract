Earth observation data are images collected by satellites orbiting the earth. The growing amount of new satellites and the continuation of established missions lead to a rapid increase of data that has never been available before. Only the Copernicus Open Access Hub contains more than 210 PB of data ready for analysis. In a nutshell, earth observation data is becoming too large to be downloaded for local analysis. 
Consequently, multiple unrelated cloud services exist in order to store and process these data. To unify access to these initiatives OpenEO (https://openeo.org/), a Horizon 2020 project (grant 776242), provides a unified API and defines a common language that fosters interoperability and reproducibility among cloud services while reducing complexity for users. 
The openEO R client allows R users to efficiently interact with big earth observation data on cloud platforms within the R language. The client is available as an R package (https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-r-client) and integrates the functionalities of openEO into the R environment. R users are enabled to create efficient and scalable workflows that can be processed by different cloud services and access resources that would otherwise not be available in a unified way via R. Additionaly, the concept of user defined functions adds the freedom of solving user specific tasks and integrates seamlessly into the concept.
